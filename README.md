# MachineLearningBeginner
ML projects I made while learning Machine Learning.

This repository includes the following projects:

1. Breast Cancer Classification:
By using Numpy and Pandas (Python libraries) I implemented a system wherein the algorithm would predict if the cancer is benign or malignant by using various parameters such as mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter etc.
I had to use Logistic Regression in order to train and test the ML model.

2. Diabetes Prediction:
By using Numpy and Pandas, I implemented a system wherein the system would predict if a person is diabetic or not on the basis of various parameters such as Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness etc.
